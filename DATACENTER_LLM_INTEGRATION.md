# Datacenter LLM Integration Summary

## Overview
The AI Universal Request widget has been successfully adapted to work with your enterprise Datacenter LLM using MID server architecture instead of direct OpenAI API calls.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. MID Server Configuration
- **REST Message**: `Datacenter LLM REST`
- **HTTP Method**: `vfos120b POST`
- **MID Server**: `al_dc_llm_mid`
- **Model**: `alliander-ai-assistant`

### 2. Response Structure Handling
The widget now handles the extended response structure from your Datacenter LLM:

```javascript
// Standard OpenAI structure (still supported)
{
  choices: [{
    message: {
      content: "AI response text"
    }
  }]
}

// Extended Datacenter LLM structure (now handled)
{
  choices: [{
    message: {
      content: "AI response text"
    }
  }],
  sources: [
    {
      filename: "document.pdf",
      filepath: "/path/to/document.pdf",
      description: "Source description"
    }
  ],
  documents: [
    {
      text_excerpt: "Relevant text from document",
      page: 15
    }
  ],
  metadata: [
    {
      embedding_score: 0.95,
      relevance: "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced callOpenAI Function
The `callOpenAI` function in server.js has been updated to:
- Extract content from the standard `choices[0].message.content` path
- Store additional metadata (sources, documents, metadata) when available
- Log the presence of additional data for debugging
- Provide graceful error handling for unexpected structures

### 4. Source Integration
Knowledge-enhanced functions now combine:
- ServiceNow Knowledge Base articles (existing functionality)
- LLM-provided sources (new functionality)
- Both are displayed in the source references section

### 5. Configuration Changes
- Replaced all `openai.api.key` checks with `datacenter.llm.enabled` property checks
- Updated model references from GPT models to `alliander-ai-assistant`
- Added MID server routing for all LLM calls
- **NEW**: Added API key authentication via `al.api.key.datacenter.llm` system property
  - API key is retrieved from system property on each LLM call
  - Included in Authorization header as `Bearer` token
  - Provides clear error message if property is not configured

## Testing

Use the provided test script (`datacenter_llm_test.js`) to verify:
1. REST Message and MID server configuration
2. Extended response structure handling
3. Dutch language support
4. Source/document extraction

## Benefits of Extended Response Structure

The additional data from your Datacenter LLM provides:
1. **Source Traceability**: Know exactly which documents the AI referenced
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Metadata includes relevance scores
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of information sources
4. **Enhanced Trust**: Users can see where information comes from

## Backwards Compatibility

The widget remains fully backwards compatible:
- If the LLM returns only the standard structure, it works normally
- If additional fields are missing, the widget continues without them
- All existing functionality is preserved

## Property Requirements

Ensure these system properties are set:
- `datacenter.llm.enabled`: Set to `true` to enable LLM functionality
- `al.api.key.datacenter.llm`: **REQUIRED** - API key for Datacenter LLM authentication
  - The API key is automatically included in the Authorization header as `Bearer <api_key>`
  - Without this property, all LLM calls will fail with an error message
- Other widget properties remain unchanged

## Error Handling

The widget now includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing or malformed response structures
- Network/MID server issues
- Unexpected data formats
- Graceful fallbacks for all scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script in ServiceNow to verify integration
2. Test with actual user queries in Dutch and English
3. Monitor logs for any unexpected response structures
4. Consider utilizing the additional source/document data for enhanced features:
   - Display source documents in responses
   - Show confidence scores
   - Link to original documents
